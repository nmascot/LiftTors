* TODO: improve Ml1

* Some E give points of J[l] def over a small field c Fq, why? (E ss?)
* Test 16 passes with x^2+1, but eval fails with x^2-1

* PicRand, PicRandTors sometimes only give pts def over small fields, and Frey-Rueck trivial!
* E[N] must not be defined over a subfield, else PicRand bad
